# Pi1541ZeroDatassettePCB
PCB design for a Pi11541 hat for the Raspberry Pi Zero with additional datassette IO support.

I wanted a Pi1541 hat for the Raspberry Pi Zero that had proper serial ports
and the pins to support my datassette support for the Pi1541.

The design is loosely based on the https://github.com/hackup/Pi1541io PCB and the components used on that PCB.
